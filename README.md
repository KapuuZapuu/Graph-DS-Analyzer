# Graph Data Structure Analyzer
C++ file creates an executable when run, from which, the user is presented with 7 options, which can be accessed by typing a num 1-7:
1. Program will read a graph ".txt" file (sample file provided), and then store its data within the program's internal variables
2. Prints the adjacency list representation of the graph.
3. Computes the shortest paths from a single source node using Dijkstra's algorithm method.
4. Computes the shortest path between two specified nodes.
5. Prints the shortest path between two specified nodes.
6. Prints the length between two specified nodes.
7. Ends program.

The program utilizes a manual implementation of the graph data structure and Djikstra's algorithm.
